The Kovan Testnet (Network ID 42) is the latest edition to the Ethereum testnet family.  Kovan is mined using the Parity client and a "Proof-of-Authority" mining protocol.

## Getting Kovan Testnet Ether

While Kovan Ether is not available for sale, its supply is restricted to limit spam attacks on the network.  You’ll have to do a little bit of work to acquire Kovan Ether, but once you have it a little goes a long way—1 Kovan Ether will pay the gas costs for hundreds of token transfers!

If you have [a Github account][gh], you can easily request 6 Kovan Ether per day.

For an instant deposit, you can [create a Github Gist containing your Ethereum address][gh-gist] and request 1 Kovan Ether every 24 hours using the `curl` command line utility.  Mac and Linux users should have `curl` installed by default in the terminal, and [Windows users can install it][curl-win].

Request 5 Kovan Ether every 24 hours by [posting your wallet address into the Kovan Testnet Gitter chat][gh-chat].  You’ll have to wait for someone to manually process your request, but you’ll generally have it within minutes or hours.

If you’re running a Parity node, you can [perform SMS verification of a mainnet address][parity-sms] to become eligible for daily automated deposits of an additional 5 Kovan Ether to that address.

### Getting Kovan Testnet Tokens

Once you have Ether, you can mint tokens by the hundreds!

Visit the [Øx OTC Portal](https://0xproject.com/portal/balances) and click (+) to add the tokens you're interested in.  Five tokens on the Kovan network (MakerDAO, Melon, Augur, DigixDAO, Golem) can be minted, 100 at a time, by clicking on the "MINT" button.
